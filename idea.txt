Nice — this is coming together nicely. Below I’ll act as your planner + tracker + consultant and give you a concrete, actionable plan: an MVP pipeline you can build now, recommended free data sources, a tech stack, the pipeline architecture, signal ideas, evaluation & monitoring, and immediate next steps you can start implementing today.

I’ll assume Python-first (easy ecosystem for data, NLP, backtesting). If you want a different language later we can adapt.

1) MVP (minimum viable product) — what we’ll build first

Goal: a single-stock daily recommendation pipeline (recommend: buy / hold / sell) that runs manually for now and later can be scheduled daily. The pipeline will:

fetch price & basic market data

fetch news + social sentiment + earnings/metrics

compute signals (rule-based / simple scoring)

produce a human-readable recommendation and explanation

send notification (email / Slack / Telegram)

log everything to a database for later backtesting

Deliverable for MVP: a runnable Python project that given a ticker returns a recommendation + short explanation and stores the decision.

2) Free data sources (recommended)

We’ll favor free sources/APIs to start:

Market price & historical data: yfinance (Yahoo Finance) — easy, no key required for many cases.

News: scraping via newsapi-like endpoints (NewsAPI has a free tier but limited), plus scraping well-known finance sites (use newspaper3k, requests + BeautifulSoup) and RSS feeds for company-specific news.

Financials / earnings: parse quarterly/annual reports using (a) company investor relations pages and PDF parsers, (b) free APIs like Finnhub / Alpha Vantage free tiers (both require API key but have free tiers). For US SEC filings, sec-edgar-downloader or EDGAR scraping is possible.

Social sentiment: Twitter (X) scraping is now limited; alternatives: Reddit (pushshift or reddit API), StockTwits (limited free access), public comment scraping from forums. You can also get aggregated sentiment from news article tone (NLP).

Macroeconomic / indexes: use free sources (FRED for US macros) and Yahoo Finance for indices.

(We’ll implement adapters so each source is pluggable; you can add paid sources later.)

3) Tech stack (recommended, opinionated)

Language / Libraries

Python 3.10+

Data: pandas, numpy

Finance data: yfinance, alpha_vantage (optional), finnhub-python (optional)

NLP / Sentiment: transformers (Hugging Face), nltk / spacy for preprocessing, vaderSentiment for social sentiment baseline

Modeling: scikit-learn, xgboost / lightgbm (if needed)

Backtesting: backtrader or vectorbt (vectorbt is excellent for quick prototyping)

Web / APIs: FastAPI for serving recommendations

DB: PostgreSQL (relational) + Redis for caching

Queue / scheduling: Celery (with Redis broker) or simple cron for MVP

Containerization: Docker

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Frontend (future SaaS): React + Tailwind

Monitoring: Sentry (errors), Prometheus / Grafana (if running infra)

Secrets: Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / or env vars for MVP

Why this stack: Python has best-in-class data & NLP libs; FastAPI is lightweight and production-ready; PostgreSQL + Docker gives portability.

4) Pipeline architecture (high level)

One pipeline per stock; components are modular so you can scale horizontally.

Ingest layer (adapters)

Price adapter (yfinance)

News adapter (RSS + site scraping)

Social adapter (Reddit / StockTwits)

Financials adapter (Alpha Vantage / filings parser)

Preprocessing

Clean & timestamp all events

Deduplicate articles / messages

Normalize numerical metrics (EPS, revenue)

Feature extraction / signals

Price signals: returns, moving averages, volatility

Fundamental signals: EPS surprise, revenue growth, margins

Sentiment signals: article tone score, social sentiment score

Event signals: earnings release, guidance revisions

Decision engine (MVP: rule-based scorer; later: ML model)

Score each signal, combine to weighted score → map to buy/hold/sell

Produce explanation: show top 3 contributing signals

Output / Action

Save recommendation + features in DB

Notify user (email/Slack/Telegram) with explanation & key stats

Backtest / Evaluate

Store historical decisions for performance review

Diagram (textual):
Adapters → Preprocessing → Signal Engine → Decision Engine → Storage → Notifications

5) Example signals (start simple; make weights configurable)

Use these for MVP (all daily):

Price/Technical:

5-day return, 20-day return

50-day SMA vs 200-day SMA (golden/death cross)

ATR (volatility)

Fundamental:

Latest EPS vs consensus (EPS surprise)

Revenue YoY growth

Analyst guidance change (if available)

Sentiment:

Avg article sentiment (last 7 days)

Social sentiment score (last 7 days)

News volume spike (sudden increase)

Event:

Earnings released in last N days (flag)

Major corporate action (M&A, buyback)

Combine into a score from −100 to +100. Map thresholds:

score > +20 → BUY

score between −20 and +20 → HOLD

score < −20 → SELL

(These thresholds are placeholders — customizable per user / stock, and you’ll tune them after backtesting.)

6) Decision logic approach (MVP → future)

Start: rule-based, explainable scoring function (transparent).

Next: use historical labeled data to train a classifier/regressor that predicts next N-day return; use SHAP/feature importance for explanations.

Why: rule-based gets you fast interpretability and safety (no surprise trades). ML later improves performance.

7) Explainability

Return a short list: top 3 signals that drove the decision, with numbers (e.g., “Social sentiment −0.4, EPS missed by 8% -> contributed −30 points”).

Persist full feature vector so you can show more depth via UI.

Use SHAP if you build ML models.

8) Notifications & integrations

Notifications: SMTP (email), Slack webhook, Telegram bot. For mobile push later: OneSignal or Pushover.

Broker integration (future): Zerodha Kite (India), Angel One, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) — start with recommendation-only; implement OAuth/keys and sandbox trading later.

Audit trail: log all recommended actions and user confirmations (important for SaaS and compliance).

9) Backtesting / Evaluation metrics

Metrics:

Cumulative return vs benchmark (e.g., index)

Annualized return, volatility

Sharpe ratio

Max drawdown

Win rate (percent profitable trades)

Use backtrader or vectorbt for quick backtests over historical data, simulating your daily decisions.

Save decisions to DB so you can replay and compute metrics.

10) Security / Compliance (must-haves even for MVP)

Store API keys in encrypted form (Vault / secrets manager). Don’t commit keys to Git.

Follow OAuth or broker sandbox rules before real trading.

Rate-limit scrapers to avoid IP bans; respect robots.txt.

Privacy: if storing user data for SaaS, plan for GDPR/CCPA if you expand.

11) SaaS considerations & multi-stock scaling

Make pipeline per-stock stateless and containerizable so you can run many pipelines in parallel.

Use a scheduler (Kubernetes CronJobs, Airflow, or just Celery beat) to run daily.

Horizontal scale: run workers that process stocks from a queue.

Multi-tenant DB model (if SaaS): tenant_id + stock ticker.

12) Project phases & concrete next steps (what I recommend you do right now)

Phase 0 — quick proof-of-concept (1–2 weeks)

Pick a single stock ticker to prototype (you choose; if you want a suggestion: AAPL or an Indian large-cap like RELIANCE.NS).

Create a Git repo and Dockerfile.

Implement price adapter using yfinance and store historical prices in Postgres.

Implement news adapter: fetch recent articles for the ticker (RSS & simple scraping). Save text + timestamp.

Compute two signals: 20-day return and avg article sentiment (VADER). Implement a simple scoring function that combines them and outputs buy/hold/sell with an explanation.

Add a simple CLI / FastAPI endpoint to request a recommendation.

Add notifications via email (SMTP) or Slack webhook.

Run manually for 10 trading days and inspect outputs.

Phase 1 — add fundamentals, backtesting, scheduling (2–4 weeks)

Add earnings/fundamental adapter, expand signals.

Hook decisions into a backtesting run (vectorbt/backtrader).

Add Celery/Cron scheduling to run daily and persist results.

Phase 2 — ML & broker integration (4–8 weeks)

Train ML model, incorporate SHAP explanations.

Add broker sandbox integration (paper trading).

Build simple React dashboard with explanation panels.

Phase 3 — SaaS hardening & scaling

Multi-tenant, user accounts, billing, more robust infra, monitoring, compliance.

13) Configuration & customization (how user customizes)

Expose a per-stock JSON config:

{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "signals": {
    "price_return_20": {"weight": 0.4},
    "sentiment_7day": {"weight": 0.3},
    "eps_surprise": {"weight": 0.3}
  },
  "thresholds": {"buy": 20, "sell": -20}
}


This lets users change weights & thresholds without code changes.

14) Sample minimal scoring formula (use for MVP)

Normalize each signal to −100..+100 (z-score or min-max over window)

Weighted sum: score = sum(weight_i * signal_i)

Map score to recommendation using thresholds (example earlier)

15) Risks & pitfalls

Data quality & latency — scrapers can miss or mis-label articles.

Overfitting if you jump to ML too quickly.

Sentiment noise — social media is noisy and can be manipulated.

Regulatory / broker rules for automated trading.

16) What I can do next for you (pick any, I’ll deliver immediately)

A. Scaffold the repo: create a starter Python project with adapters for yfinance, a news adapter (RSS), simple sentiment (VADER), a rule-based scorer, and a FastAPI endpoint.

B. Write the initial scoring + config file and a sample run for a ticker (I can implement logic and show sample output).

C. Draft a detailed data model (Postgres schema) and CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) config.

D. Create a simple React dashboard mockup (can use canmore if you want a preview).

Which one do you want me to do right now? Also, which stock ticker should we prototype on (or should I pick a commonly used one like AAPL)?
